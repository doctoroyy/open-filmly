## Project Status

Open Filmly is currently in active development. Core functionality for media scanning, categorization, and metadata fetching is working. The media player integration, subtitle matching, and watch progress tracking features are still being developed.

### Roadmap:
- Complete the media player integration
- Implement subtitle auto-detection and matching
- Add user watch history and progress tracking
- Improve UI/UX for the media browsing experience
- Add user profiles and preferences

## Development

This project uses pnpm as the package manager. Make sure to install pnpm first:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run in development mode

For frontend development only:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

For full Electron app development:
```bash
pnpm dev:electron
```

This will start both the Vite development server and the Electron app with hot reload.

### Build for production

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm dist
```

The `dist` command will clean, build, and create distributable packages for all platforms.

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+
- pnpm 7+

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Electron main process with Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- **Network Storage**: SMB/CIFS client for NAS access
- **Metadata**: TMDB API integration
- **Build**: electron-builder for cross-platform packaging
